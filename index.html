                <h4> decade: 2010s</h4>

                <p>
                    The song “3005” by Childish Gambino was released in 2013 and uses two zeroes in the title. 
                    Roughly a year after the song was released, a secret remix was discovered by fans by piecing 
                    together lines of code that were in a screenplay based around the music on his album (Fleischer). 
                    The secret remix is known as the Beach Picnic Version and features the same chorus as the original 
                    version, just in a higher pitch, and includes a slower tempo and a more relaxed vibe. In a religious 
                    context, the idea of a cipher may be interpreted as seeking deeper meaning, as religious truths can 
                    be revealed to those who do the work to decode surface-level symbols, texts, and traditions. For 3005, 
                    fans that were willing to put in the work to decode ciphered messages in the screenplay were rewarded 
                    with the secret remix. It is clear that the significance of the number zero extends beyond the title 
                    of the song and that the screenplay associated with the song was a cipher for fans.

                <h2>One Mic, Nas</h2>
                <h4> decade: 2000s</h4>

                <p>
                    One Mic is the third single off of Nas’ fifth studio album, Stillmatic, released in December of 2001. Although 
                    not a Five Percenter himself, Nas is thought to have embodied some of NGE’s teachings in his music. One Mic 
                    is Nas’ furthest venture into Supreme Mathematics. Throughout the song, Nas leverages the ‘One’ in the song’s 
                    title and main refrain to drop knowledge. The song features dense and oftentimes intense verses, discussing police 
                    violence in inner cities, which is especially apparent in the song’s music video. Eventually, the song is brought 
                    back down to lower heat by the soft delivery of the chorus: <i><b>“All I need is one mic”.</b></i> Outside of the number one, the 
                    track is littered with allusions to Supreme Mathematics with repeated two and nines. Additionally, the following two 
                    tracks on Stillmatic are “2nd Childhood” and “Destroy & Rebuild,” inconspicuous references to NGE wisdom and the number 
                    8, respectively. Yet, Verse 2 dives deeper into the Fiver Percenter way, calculating supreme values in his bars: 
                    <b><i>“Jesus died at age thirty-three, there’s thirty-three shots/From twin Glocks, there’s sixteen apiece that’s 
                    thirty-two/Which means one of my guns was holdin’ seventeen/Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you.”</b></i> 
                    Ultimately, One Mic is an instance of Nas leveraging Five Percenter theology to discuss his own faith, appealing 
                    to ‘One God,’ ‘virgin blood,’ and ‘Jesus’ to grant his wish for a simple life and to be absolved of sin. Here,
                    Nas in communion with NGE uses ‘One’ to acknowledge the truth of a situation and reroute the situation towards 
                    the fundamental simplicity of God, which he views as the solution.

                <h4> decade: 2010s</h4>

                <p>
                    The Heart series by Kendrick Lamar is a journey through his life and career serving as benchmarks 
                    for an emotional ride of each of his music. Specifically part 2 is Kdot rapping about his city of Compton, 
                    having moments where he prioritizes genuine emotion over simply stringing impressive lyrical content. 
                    He aims to convey raw emotion and connect deeply with his audience through his lyrics. Wisdom is the ability 
                    to make sensible decisions and give good advice because of the experience you have.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Because of Kendricks upbringing he is able to display to the listener what he has been through and how it 
                    currently influences his decisions, even making a connection with God in the process. <b><i>“I ain’t perfect / I ain’t seen 
                    too many churches or know them testament verses”</i></b>, Kendrick now defines himself as Christian, and this is early in his 
                    career but he acknowledges his imperfections and lack of religious upbringing showing self-awareness and humility. 
                    <i><b> “My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn’t wrapped too tight / He told me ‘Rap about life, not rap n****s”</i></b> he provides wisdom, 
                    literal advice from his incarcerated uncle recognizing his own importance of rapping about real-life experiences.  
                    The heart series allows listeners to better connect with Kdot on an emotional level, <i><b>“ 
                    Im tryna purchase my momma dem’ Benzes / Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions / Just to coincide, 
                    just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living”</b></i>. Here we see his motivations for success, displaying his material desires
                    while also questioning the deeper meaning and purpose behind them.

                <h2>3 Kings, Rick Ross, Dr.Dre, Jay-Z</h2>
                <h4> decade: 2010s</h4>

                <p>
                    3 Kings is the third track off of Rick Ross’ 2012 album “God Forgives, I Don’t,” featuring two other hip-hop 
                    and rap legends in Dr. Dre and Jay-Z. 3 Kings was made long after the peak of Five Percenter popularity in 
                    the hip-hop scene and this distance is evident in the lack of meaning placed behind numbers cited on the record. 
                    However, the track is an important reminder of the influence of NGE theology, and religious doctrine at large, 
                    in hip-hop music. Nas’ One Mic offers a great foil to 3 Kings. Both tracks use numbers in the same frequency and 
                    fashion, often and at beginning or end of a bar. In verse 3, Jay-Z rhymes <i><b>“They workin’ on another deal, they 
                    talkin’ two-hundred-fifty!/I’m holding out for three/Two-seventy-five and I just might agree.”</b></i> Clearly, Ross’ 
                    song lacks the spiritual element that Nas’ masters, using Supreme Mathematics as a concept but not for any 
                    specific purpose. Between the divine mathematics of NGE and the Christian story of the birth of Jesus, 3 Kings 
                    holds a lot of spiritual potential, but ignores it beyond an aesthetic title. The most sympathetic reading of 3 
                    Kings is with respect to Five Percenters, using the number three to emphasize the understanding of three hip-hop 
                    sages between Ross, Jay, and Dre.

                <h2>Jesus Walks, Kanye</h2>
                <h4> decade: 2000s</h4>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the number four represents culture and freedom. The song “Jesus Walks” is the 
                    fourth track off Kanye’s 2004, debut album The College Dropout. As the fourth track on the album, 
                    “Jesus Walks” portrays religious themes and bridges the gap between mainstream rap culture and religion. 
                    At the time, the themes that dominated mainstream hip-hop were understood as explicitly non-religious. 
                    Drugs, alcohol, sex, money, gangs, and violence were the themes associated with mainstream hip-hop, 
                    enforcing its distance from religious themes. “Jesus Walks” was nominated at the 2005 Grammy awards 
                    for the song of the year, adding to the notion of the song achieving mainstream success while promoting 
                    religious themes. Moreover, the second version of the music video to “Jesus Walks” heavily references the 
                    freedom that one receives by way of their belief in Christ. The video depicts a fire around Kanye but it 
                    is unable to hurt him because he had God protecting him, essentially saying that those with God are free 
                    from the tortures of hell. In the context of religion, culture and freedom are relevant for how individuals 
                    form and express unique religious beliefs. The freedom to develop and express individual religious beliefs 
                    is important and each person’s beliefs will be developed from the culture by which they are surrounded. 
                    In the context of “Jesus Walks”, Kanye challenged expectations and norms in the hip-hop industry, showcasing 
                    the freedom artists have to explore diverse subject matter and express their beliefs. Also, by promoting 
                    religious themes, Kanye bridged a cultural divide and sparked conversations about spirituality and religion 
                    within hip-hop. In the context of the music video, Kanye makes it clear that those who have Jesus are free. 
                    As the fourth track on The College Dropout, “Jesus Walks” affirms the number four’s significance in both freedom and culture.

                <p>
                    The 5 deadly venoms refer to the five individuals on the track rapping bars on this track that directly 
                    reflect themes of power, aggression and dominance. Each verse portrays a persona characterized by confidence, dominance  
                    and confronting challanges head on. Each lyric is bold and assertive from individuals who are unapologetically 
                    in pursuit of power and dominance. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Some bars include: 

                    <i><b>

                    "*laughter* We going platinum n***a, we going platinum",
                    "I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block",
                    "Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch",
                    "We takin this motherfucker over, trust, we out"

                    </i></b>

                    My personal favorite is the double entandre, <i><b>"Now they after me, prowling for a n***s bucks
                    Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts" </i></b>about people's jelousy of his alpha male status having money 
                    while trying to provoke 2Pac to violence.
                    <br><br>

                    Whether boasting about achievements, asserting their prowess, or issuing warnings, each line 
                    is delivered with boldness and assertiveness to enphasizes their relentless display of power and dominance. 
                    From the laughter signaling their success to the descriptions of weapons and confrontations, 
                    each lyric revolves around power.

                <h2>The 6th Sense, Common</h2>
                <h4> decade: 2000s</h4>

                <p>
                    6th Sense is the first single from Common’s 2000 album Like Water for Chocolate. Common 
                    is a known and celebrated Five Percenter, a fact which comes through musically and 
                    thematically on the track. 6th sense, similar to Nas’ One Mic, leverages divine mathematics 
                    for a socially conscious and spiritual goal. Throughout the track, Common is set on communicating 
                    the social ills of the world, calling himself <b><i>“Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit.”</i></b> 
                    This bar is a clear allusion to the 6 in the song title, striving for equality of knowledge, wisdom, 
                    and understanding as each verse works to analyze his world critically as well as introspectively and 
                    offer that conclusion to the audience. One instance of this is the opening of verse 2, where Common raps
                    <i><b>“In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries.”</i></b> Here, Common points out the issue of Arab business 
                     proprietors in his area not wanting to engage with the black community, including the ‘two’ as a hint of 
                     this. Additionally, the track is comfortable being overtly religious and existing in the intersection of
                      NGE and the Nation of Islam as Common raps <i><b>“through me, Muhammad will forever speak,”</i></b> aligning his words
                       with the truth of a prophet in harmony with the number six’s representation of equality.

                <p>
                    Overall, The message of Thugz Mansion displays themes of struggle, resilience and the 
                    longing for a sense of peace in the face of adversity. The metaphorical “Thug Mansion” 
                    is where individuals can refuge from the harsh realities of being African American growing 
                    up on the streets. One of the most meaningful songs by 2Pac, talks about how he would rest 
                    in peace and eventually find happiness where all troubles from his life come to an end and 
                    hoping to find a place of peace after he dies.

                    However, the 7 remix is a more soulful version of the mix. As this song was released posthumously 
                    the number 7 is much more significant. Named 7 remix because it was mixed by a producer “7 Aurelius” 
                    has a deeper meaning as he is notably a follower of God. Also known as 7 Channel, it would not be 
                    surprising if 7 was actually referred to the Supreme numbers as they specifically chose this number 
                    for the posthumous remix. Although his definitely doesn't mention God, these religious themes are very 
                    reinforced. It has very strong messages and the remix re-emphasizes this message. Notable  lyrics are 
                    <i><b>”Dear mama, don’t cry, your baby boy’s doin’ good / Tell the homies I’m in Heaven and they ain’t got hoods.” 
                    </b></i>

                <h2>Straight Outta Compton, NWA</h2>
                <h4> decade: 1980s</h4>

                <p>
                    N.W.A’s album, Straight Outta Compton was released on August 8, 1988 or 8/8/88. The album protests 
                    police violence in Los Angeles, acting as a source of both building and destruction. The album 
                    received a lot of backlash for its vulgar language and violent themes. In a Los Angeles Times article 
                    titled “The Moment N.W.A Changed the Music World,” Gerrick Kennedy writes, “‘Straight Outta Compton’ 
                    was a flash point that spoke for a disenfranchised community and disrupted the order of those who were 
                    confronted with the voices and images of a community they’d much rather ignore” (Kennedy). The confrontational 
                    nature of the album was inherently destructive in its attempt to disrupt the oppressive systems that lead to 
                    police brutality. As a source of destruction, the album challenges an oppressive system in an attempt to disrupt
                    and destroy the systems that lead to police violence. Furthermore, Kennedy explains how the title of the track 
                    “Fuck Tha Police” was explicitly used to protest police brutality during the late 80s and early 90s and ultimately 
                    remained “a rallying cry in L.A.” during the Black Lives Matter movement. As a source of building, the album sparks 
                    conversations around social change and seeks to build communities. In a religious context, the ideas of building and
                    destruction are relevant in personal transformation, where people seek to destroy the old version of themselves and
                    build a new, better version of themselves. This is similar in the case of this album, where N.W.A seeks to destroy
                    current systems in place and build new, less oppressive systems. Releasing the album on 8/8/88 confirms the number 
                    eight’s importance related to the concepts of building and destruction.

                <h2>99 Problems, Jay-Z</h2>
                <h4> decade: 2000s</h4>

                <p>
                    99 Problems is the third single off of Jay-Z’s 2003 album, The Black Album. Like Nas, Jay-Z 
                    has never come out as a member of the Nations of Gods and Earths but has carried the influence 
                    of their teachings in his music. In addition to the double 9 in its title, the track is positioned 
                    as the 9th listing on the album, emphasizing the Five Percenter concept of birth. Moreover, Jay-Z 
                    creates the implication of the number 1 and consequently, knowledge by using the number 99. The 
                    combination of birth (9) and knowledge (1) create a full circle moment for Jay-Z, who was at the time 
                    announcing his retirement from hip-hop. His fascination with both of these themes also pairs well with 
                    the socially-conscious attitude of the song, exposing police mistreatment and more.
